<!-- Use this file to provide workspace-specific custom instructions to Copilot. For more details, visit https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_use-a-githubcopilotinstructionsmd-file -->

## Project Overview
This is a cutting-edge wildlife conservation tokenization platform called FaunaX, built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The platform enables global donors to buy fractional NFTs representing conservation assets and track real-time impact.

## Design System
- **Theme**: Minimalist, futuristic, eco-modern with green gradients, deep black backgrounds, glassmorphism, and neon highlights
- **Typography**: Bold headline fonts, clean sans-serif body text, strong hierarchy
- **Layout**: Responsive grid system, card-based asset display, fluid animations
- **Mood**: Trust, transparency, and global impact

## Key Technologies
- Next.js 14+ with App Router
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion for animations
- Lucide React for icons
- Radix UI for accessible components

## Component Guidelines
- Use server components by default, client components only when needed for interactivity
- Implement responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Include smooth transitions and micro-animations
- Follow accessibility best practices
- Use semantic HTML structure

## Styling Conventions
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Implement dark mode with eco-theme palette
- Use CSS custom properties for theme colors
- Apply glassmorphism effects for modern UI
- Ensure consistent spacing and typography scale

## Performance Considerations
- Optimize images with Next.js Image component
- Implement lazy loading for NFT cards
- Use React Server Components for static content
- Minimize client-side JavaScript bundle size
